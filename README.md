Assignments for subject TDT4136 - Introduction to artificial intelligence


This course introduced me to a lot of ideas behind artificial intelligence, and also learned me alot about some usual algorithms. 
Which we see is used in these assignments. Alongside these assignments, we also had a 4th one which we programmed, however which i am not allowed to publish.
All in all a fun course with some fun assignments alongside it, proud of my solutions altought they perhaps are not the best.
